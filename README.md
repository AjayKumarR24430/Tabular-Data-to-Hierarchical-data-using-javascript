# Convert Tabular data into hierarchical tree structure

## USING JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS

This repository consists of the algorithm on how to convert a tabular (excel,csv file) data into a hierarchical, organised structure, using javascript.

Python can be used to convert the excel into csv format and subsequently convert the csv file into json format, which makes the process of utilizing the data much easier. 

The json data then can be dumped into a file, to keep it separately which can be used by the javascript functions to successfully convert it to a tree structure.

### Steps required to see the tree structure:
* Download/clone this repository.
* View the html file in the browser which will be displaying the hierarchical data in a well-organised structure.
* In the console, the tree structure can be found -  a simple representation of the tabular data in hierarchical data instead of a flat data.
